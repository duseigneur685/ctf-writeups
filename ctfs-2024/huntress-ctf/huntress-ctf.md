#Huntress CTF 2024

This was my first CTF I participated since starting out in Cybersecurity. Was pretty fun to solve what I could . I still need heaps of practice, and much more to learn , but was exciting. 
I was also attempting the Deadface CTF , but i wish i attempted more of the challenges.

This is to document the challenges I solved (beginning of my writeup journey)
